I was fourteen years old and I had no idea what it would be like to go to another state â€“ a place where life is so different - to serve others on my churchâ€™s mission trip. It was my first ministry outreach trip, and I was nervous because I would be in a new, unfamiliar situation. The trip was to New Orleans, where the poverty-stricken city was still recovering from Hurricane Katrina ten years later. While rebuilding houses, one particular familyâ€™s story stood out to me, and the perspective on life I got from that family I will remember forever. The family of five told us about how much their lives changed because of the natural disaster. After living off of food stamps and sleeping on their relativeâ€™s floors for months, the house we were rebuilding for them would be the start of a new chapter of their lives. Although they had so little, they never stopped having a positive and hopeful outlook on life. That resonated with me and made all my small, petty problems seem so unimportant when there were so many others that were much worse off. While my contributions seemed small, it played a huge role in helping them back on their feet, and that was incredibly humbling. I was so grateful for the opportunity to interact with the affected families and hear their stories, understand their struggles, and see the reality of poverty in an unfamiliar city. Outreach is now such an important part of my life because that experience made me see past myself and my own problems, and focus on giving back to the community. After that experience, it has made me more excited to involve myself in organizations like Fish Camp that make an impact on others. Reaching out to the freshmen to make their transition into college easier is something that isnâ€™t terribly hard on a camp counselorâ€™s part, but makes a huge impact in the life of those freshmen.","When I signed up for fish camp, I thought it would simply be a place to meet others and learn the traditions of my future school. Little did I know, Iâ€™d meet people that I now consider my family and will be my lifelong friends. It is so important that a freshman feels welcomed and secured and not afraid to get out of their comfort zone to meet new people. For example, I drastically changed as the days of fish camp passed; at first I was really uncomfortable and not outgoing but with the help of the counselors acting crazy and unreserved, my attitude completely changed. I started yelling all the chants until I lost my voice and you could find me in the middle of the circles at the mixers. I can confidently say that without the counselorâ€™s help in getting me out of my comfort zone, fish camp would not have been nearly as enjoyable and I wouldnâ€™t have reached out to people that are my best friends now. My camp counselors were a great model of what I hope to be: so extremely close with the other counselors, supportive of any and every freshman they encountered, and most importantly making sure that they were our true friends, at fish camp and long after. That is exactly what I want future freshmen to experience: a time where they feel the support of a family that will be there for them the next four years. That is why continuity is the most important part of fish camp; the real bonding and relationship building happens after leaving Lakeview, and I plan on making sure those relationships donâ€™t hit a dead end. A camp counselor is a really special role to have and if I were one, I would make sure a freshman never feels alone or unwanted by going out of my way to hang out with them and find ways to help them acclimate to a new environment. Showing them around campus, going on a Fuego run, giving them rides, or just going to the park and hanging out. Even though these are small interactions, I want to be there for the freshmen, whether they need me or not, because itâ€™s important for them to know that they have me to look up to.","I know being a camp counselor is no easy task. It takes months and months of planning and coming together on common ideas will be difficult. Learning from the issues at hand and listening to otherâ€™s suggestions can make all the difference, and that is something I definitely plan on doing. It takes passion and commitment, and the presence or lack thereof will be obvious. That can make or break the experience us as counselors will have preparing for camp, and the time the freshmen have at Fish Camp and after. To be successful as a camp counselor means putting in the effort that I would want for myself and nothing less. It means spending those extra hours perfecting a skit that will help a freshmen learn about an Aggie tradition. It means staying organized and prepared in the face of adversity. It means bonding with your camp and creating those relationships that will lead to a united and supportive front for the freshmen to depend upon. Again, I want to emphasize how important continuity is to me. The four days at Fish Camp are great, but relationships with the freshmen can only go so far in that short amount of time. It requires additional effort on a counselorâ€™s part to make time to spend with their freshmen and that should be a goal that every counselor should have: getting to know their freshmen even better after camp ends. Additionally, I know how is important for counselors, especially first years, to turn to their chairs and elders for advice on how to go about situations or ideas of how to build relationships with the freshmen. As a person with no experience as a camp counselor, I strive to reach out to other counselors in a time of need for assistance because I know they are willing to help. That can help me grow as a person, and make my experience as a counselor great, and hopefully the freshmenâ€™s experience at Fish Camp even better. I canâ€™t guarantee that I will be the perfect camp counselor, but in what I plan to achieve as stated above, hopefully I can get really close.",,N/A,

Someone that can bolt out notes like a train horn. Unfortunately, for me I am a guy with the voice that sounds like someone scratching a chalk board with a hanger. Therefore, I have to go against all of my instincts in order to save the ears of the people around me. This brings me to the Fish Camp value I try to embody everyday- compassion. While I do save the eardrums of those around me, I do try to go out of my way to help others in other ways.     This unconditional love is a huge factor that truly makes Fish Camp unique. Even if it is someone you just met in March, people in a camp will stop and help you no matter what. Last year, a friend of mine that I barely knew told me that she was going to an academic meeting because someone stole her work from her computer. After her meeting, I made sure to meet up with her because I knew that it was going to be hard on her as she was a very dedicated and high achieving person. It was hard for her and I wanted to be there for her. I knew that if I was put into the same situation, I would be a complete mess. The amazing part is that she would have been there for me too if it was me instead of her. While this is just one specific example, I try to hold myself to this value in my everyday life in any situation.     If someone is sick, I help them get the notes from class. If a friend tells me that they need someone to move them out, I will be there at 8AM on my day off. If someone calls me as frantic mess about how they just broke up with their long time significant other, I will be on the phone with them all night to give them catharsis. I do all these things because others would do them for me. While I do hold those around me to the expectation that they would do these things for me, I know I can trust those around me, especially people that are in my Fish Camp.","Coming to A&M, I was terrified. I knew only two people. I did not know any of the traditions. I did not know if I was going to be able to survive my major (some things never change). But at Fish Camp before my freshman year, I was alleviated of my fears. Three years later, I can still remember the chair of the camp sitting down with me and I told her I wasn't sure if I could do it. It turned out that she was also in the same major that I was. She gave me all the protips I needed to succeed. My DG dad also helped me through the transition. He was always there for me during the first few weeks, even if it was just to sit there and listen to me. In the past few years, I have attempted to do exactly the same for the highly stressed kids. While I am probably just the Great Value version of my DG dad and the chair, I have attempted to do exactly what they did for me and overall have been successful.      Fish Camp can be difficult sometimes. Staying up until 3AM on 1DB4. Repeating the same skit 20 times until it is perfect. Chugging honey simply so that I can talk. It is all worth it in the end when I hear a freshman say ""I was terrified but you helped me through it"" because that's the exact position I was in three years ago. That is why I applied for Fish Camp my first year and that is a large part of why I am applying this year. The brings me to the next reason why I am applying this year. Your Fish Camp becomes your family at Texas A&M. As a third year, I am to be an asset to the chairs in developing the camp into their vision and into a family. I have had a great time in Fish Camp and a large amount of that can be credited to the families I have been welcomed into. Now, I want to be the person that helps develop that family. I love Fish Camp and I want other people to feel the same love by giving them a great experience like I have had whether it is the counselors in March or freshmen in August.","Fish Camp has developed me into the person that I am today. At the beginning of my first year, I wasn't even able to speak in front of a group or even send a message in the GroupMe because I was terrified of saying something that I would get roasted for. Despite my best efforts, I was still roasted to charcoal by the third year in my camp. While this may seem like someone targeting my insecurities, I grew tremendously from it and am now able to be a- somewhat- normal person.      My second year, I was placed with an introverted partner. All I knew was that she was an incredibly nice person and I wasn't sure how our partnership would turn out because I have only dealt with ""savage"" people. The day after Partner Rev I started working on bringing her out of her shell by sending her a ""Meme of the Day"" which mostly contained some type of cringe-worthy pun. Over time, I slowly started to see her develop into a silent savage to me but still remained the sweetest person to everyone else. It wasn't until camp when I truly saw my work come to fruition. I sat back, let her run a DG time and watched her run Mafia flawlessly with situations I could never have thought of.      Since then, I've thought about it and I truly think that this is what success looks like as a second and third year. This year, I'm applying for the same success story. I want to develop the first and second years. I want to see people that are uncomfortable in groups become the spotlights. I want to be the asset that the third years in my previous camps have been for me and the people around me. This is my last year in camp and I want to develop the people that will continue the legacy of development as they are the future of Fish Camp. I understand that some third years have tried to take over camps and I intend to stray far from that. My job is to focus more on the growth individuals rather than the camp as a whole. Therefore, my success is determined by the development of those individuals around me- just like those that helped me develop into me.",,n/a,

I was a football player who took all AP classes and who loved things such as sports, orchestra, and video games all the same. I surrounded myself with all different types of people every day. Somedays I would go eat lunch with my football buds and play madden in the locker room and talk about the fantasy league we were in, while other days I would go eat with my orchestra buddy's and talk about the upcoming pieces we were going to play. There was an incident where some of my friends in my AP classes and some members on the football team got into fight over social media. Both had completely different political views and values which caused them to get into an argument. It was escalating downward really fast, however, I acted as an intermediate between each group and was able to calm both sides, convincing them that everyone has a right to their different opinions but that you should respect other people's opinions too. I wouldn't have been able to help resolve this if I hadn't surrounded myself with the diversity in the different mindsets and values which really shaped the person who I am now. At Fish Camp I will make sure that we maintain a diverse environment. No matter what my freshmen's backgrounds are, I will be that intermediate between each and every one of them to make sure they feel they are welcome and incorporated in this diverse environment. If I have one super conservative and one very liberal freshmen that constantly butt heads with each other, I will make sure that by the end they understand and respect each other and feel equally apart of our newfound family. The same goes with the counselors I know there will be complete polar opposite personalities on our camp, but as I was in high school, I will be that intermediate between both extremes and try to shape our camp into one family.","As an incoming freshman, I would really want a welcoming experience where I truly felt wanted and accepted at A&M. As a Fish Camp counselor, I will be their best friend, and provide them assurance that they choose the right university, one that accepts everyone with open arms. Personally for me, A&M was not my first choice in college, but it has such a great engineering program that I couldnâ€™t pass it up. Going into Fish Camp last year, I had no idea what to expect from A&M except for the notorious stereotypes that it had. I also feared that I wouldnâ€™t be able to find my place at this huge university. However, I luckily had two awesome D.G. parents, Alex Smider and Mitchell Gay, that were able to guide me and provide to me the assurance that I needed that I choose the right school. As a Fish Camp counselor, I will be that guiding light for my freshman, and I will pour all time and energy into creating the best environment and experience for my freshmen that I possibly can. Once school starts, I will also make sure that Iâ€™m there for them in those first couple weeks when they donâ€™t know anyone and havenâ€™t joined any organizations yet. Whether it is organizing a camp-wide sports event, or a grill out at my apartment, I will make sure that they have the option to do something besides sit in their dorm all day. Also, since the university is so big in terms of its amount of organizations, I will make sure that each of my freshmen know all the different types of organizations there are. I will encourage and even attend informationals with them, whether it is even something that does not pertain to me such as a religious organization that does not match mine or a club that is more oriented to a different race or ethnicity than mine. I want to make sure that they get involved and enjoy their time here at the greatest university in the world. I personally had my D.G. parents tell me what organizations were here at A&M and they went to informationals with me, so I want to give the same time and effort as my D.G. parents put in for me in my involvement in my freshmenâ€™s lives at A&M.","For Fish Camp I will set many goals for myself such as creating a welcoming environment for my freshmen and creating long lasting continuity with my freshmen. My ability to hold myself to my goals for my freshman will allow me to be the best fish camp counselor I can possibly be. All of my life, no matter what I committed myself to, I have always set myself incredibly high goals and have not stopped until I achieved them. For example, when I joined Boy Scouts in 6th grade I had heard plenty of stories of people not working hard enough and not getting Eagle Scout before they aged out and turned eighteen. However I worked for five long years so I could achieve my Eagle Scout. So if I hear my freshman talking about goals they want to set for themselves when they start college, I will be there to support them and make sure that they are achieving them at A&M. I want them to start off their experience at A&M right and unlike those people that aged out of Boy Scouts, I want my freshmen to have no regrets about what they did during their first year here. Also, back in highschool I worked for a company called Mathnasium as a math tutor for ages 5-18. With every student of mine, I set and achieved the goals of improving their knowledge in math and creating a fun and open environment as their friend and teacher. When I say Iâ€™ll create a welcoming environment and continuity with my freshman I will. Just like at my job, I will make sure I am always there for them as a friend when they advice on a personal problem in their life. In all our small talks, no matter what my freshman are interested in, Iâ€™ll make sure that they feel open to talk about whatever they want to and that they know that Iâ€™ll be there to listen and understand them.  Whether it is being their best friend, study buddy, or just someone who gives them advice when they need it, Iâ€™ll continually be there for them.",,N/A,
